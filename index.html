      Our perception of time changes as we age. When we're younger and experiencing the pieces of the world
      entirely as new stimuli, we perceive time as passing slower because everything requires adjustment. But
      when we age and settle into a routine — an alignment of tasks that we are familiar with to the point
      of autocompleting them — time passes a lot more quickly.

        This grid represents the average US life expectancy - <b>80 years</b>, according to the
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm">CDC</a> in 2016, which boasts
        a lengthy 78.6 years.

        It doesn't seem like much. But let's take a look at some life spans from previous centuries, in comparison
        to the 80 years we've come to expect. We'll start with some figures from the 1600's.
