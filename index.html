    <h1>Putting Time into Perspective</h1>

      Our perception of time changes as we age. When we're younger and experiencing the pieces of the world
      entirely as new stimuli, we perceive time as passing slower because everything requires adjustment. But
      when we age and settle into a routine, an alignment of tasks that we are familiar with to the point
      of autocompleting them, time passes a lot more quickly.

        This grid represents the average US life expectancy - 80 years, according to the
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm">CDC</a> in 2016, which boasts
        a lengthy 78.6 years. Each square represents a week, and each row represents one year.
